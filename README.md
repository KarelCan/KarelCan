- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KarelCan
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve studied Sales and Marketing, but I got more and more interested in programming starting somewhere in June 2021.
- ğŸ“š I've started with FreeCodeCamp's 300 hour courses: "Responsive Web Development" and "Javascript Datastructures", and then moved on to Udemy courses
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a Junior Front End developer with Angular in Dynaway.
