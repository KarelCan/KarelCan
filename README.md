- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KarelCan
- ðŸ‘€ I have worked in a field unrelated to programming, but starting to learn about it in June 2021
- ðŸ“š I've started with FreeCodeCamp's 300 hour courses: "Responsive Web Development" and "Javascript Datastructures", and then moved on to Udemy courses like
      - "Angular - The Complete Guide" 
      - "Angular & NodeJS - The MEAN Stack Guide"
      - "Complete Web Design: from Figma to Webflow to Freelancing" (improving in styling and learning to prototype before development)
- ðŸŒ± Since July 2022 I work as a Junior Front End developer with Angular (+ Ionic) in Dynaway.
